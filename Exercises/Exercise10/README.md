# Debezium - Data Transformations with SMT (Optional)

## Introduction

As explained in the lesson, Debezium provides a way to apply changes (transformations, filters, etc.) to the data that flows from the database (more info here: https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/index.html). In this exercise with we will be using SMT and the filtering scripting language to filter individual messages.

## Pre-requisites

Follow the steps in the setup exercise to launch the required components.

## Exercise

In this exercise you are "on your own", but you can follow the steps in the documentation to install and run:

* https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.7/configuration/filtering.html

Apply some simple filters to the "customers" messages and confirm they are working fine. For the filtering logic you can use the one in the links, or apply your own.
